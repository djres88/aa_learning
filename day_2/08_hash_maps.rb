# Exercises:
#
# Write a function called word_lengths(str) that given a sentence, returns a hash of each of the words and their lengths.
# E.g., word_lengths("hello my good good pal") should return { 'hello' => 5, 'my' => 2, 'good' => 4, 'pal' => 3 }





# Write a function called uniq(arr) that returns only the unique values in an array. (Hint: use a hash!)




# Write a function called greatest_val_key(hash) that takes in a hash with any keys but only integers for values, and returns the key with the largest value.



# E.g., greatest_val_key({ "a" => 5, "b" => 6, "c" => 3 }) should return "b"
